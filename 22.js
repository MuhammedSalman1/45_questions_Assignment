// Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.

// The following line will not execute due to the error above, but I'll add it to demonstrate the correct way to access elements in an array
